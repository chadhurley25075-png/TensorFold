"""GLM-5.3-Flash (model_type ``glm5_next``): an MLX engine on one Apple Silicon Mac, and a CUDA engine tensor
parallel over two DGX Sparks.

45 decoder layers over a hidden size of 4,096: 34 of Kimi delta attention and 11 of DeepSeek sparse attention
(MLA with an indexer), 288 routed experts (top 8) plus a shared expert, four residual streams mixed by
hyper-connections, a 154,880-token vocabulary and an MTP layer. The MLX 4-bit checkpoint is 182 GB and Mia's
EXL3 one (routed experts in ExLlamaV3's 4-bit trellis format, the rest in BF16, ``cuda/exl3.py``) 164 GB.

On a Mac (``load``): ``model`` is TensorFold's forward pass for the checkpoint, with a decode path whose rows each
get one-row bits; ``tensorfold.kernels.glm.flash.v1`` holds its Metal kernels; ``mtp`` is the checkpoint's MTP
layer; ``runtime`` is what the lane engine's family rounds serve (``engine.lane_family``: exact MTP drafting when
the load-time row check passes). It needs a Mac with 256 GB or more and reads the MLX 4-bit checkpoint only.

On NVIDIA GPUs (``cuda_engine``): each Spark holds half of every layer (``cuda/``). Drafts come from the
checkpoint's MTP head and, when it has been pulled on both machines, from the DFlash2 draft model.
Recipe and measurements for both: docs/recipes/glm-5.3-flash.md.
