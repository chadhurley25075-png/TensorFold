TensorFold serves a local LLM on Apple Silicon or NVIDIA GPUs at an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, fast and exact.
Name a model on Hugging Face, choose the context window and sampling, and TensorFold downloads it, loads it with
Metal or CUDA kernels written for that model family, and serves `/v1/chat/completions`. On DGX Spark it decodes
1.6 to 3x faster than vLLM with MTP drafts, one Spark or two ([DGX Spark](#dgx-spark-and-other-nvidia-gpus)).

**All Apple Silicon chips now support lane batching.** Qwen3.8-27B verifies its drafted tokens together in one
forward on every M1 to M5 GPU, and its output stays byte-identical to serial decoding: through the lane kernels
on M5, and on M1 to M4 through TensorFold's own row-exact lane decoder and simdgroup matmul (0.3.4: 1.9 to 4x
serial speed on an M3 Ultra, [details](docs/recipes/qwen3.8-27b.md#macs-without-tensor-units-m1-to-m4)).
Nemotron and Flash Next run on the same lane engine.

Setting this up with an AI agent? Give it the [AI agent runbook](RUNBOOK.md) for the install, model download,
server startup and a request that checks the result.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ashhart/TensorFold.git
tensorfold serve Vontra/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3.5-Lightning-30B-A3B-MLX-4bit --context 65536
```

Any OpenAI client can then use `http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1`, including coding agents, SDKs and `curl`:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "NVIDIA-Nemotron-3.5-Lightning-30B-A3B-MLX-4bit", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hi"}]}'
```

TensorFold needs a Mac with Apple Silicon and Python 3.11 or newer. It is tested with MLX 0.31.2 on an M5 Max
and MLX 0.32.0 on an M3 Ultra. Flash Next and Nemotron check at load that drafted rows reproduce one-row decoding
on your MLX and GPU, and draft only when they do. On an M5, MLX 0.32.2 fails that check for Nemotron, which
then runs without drafts (same output, slower); `pip install mlx==0.31.2` brings them back. The Qwen3.8-27B lane
kernels do their own arithmetic, so their exactness does not depend on the MLX version.

## Models

Each model family has its own package of kernels, picked from the checkpoint's `config.json`. These are the
checkpoints TensorFold is built and tested with, all on Hugging Face:

| Model | Pull | Size | Mac |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nemotron 3.5 Lightning 30B-A3B | `Vontra/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3.5-Lightning-30B-A3B-MLX-4bit` | 18.6 GB | 32 GB or more |
| Qwen3.8-27B | `Vontra/Qwen3.8-27B-MLX-4bit` and its draft model `z-lab/Qwen3.8-27B-DFlash2` | 16.1 GB + 3.8 GB | 32 GB or more; an M5-generation GPU for the fast kernels |
| Qwen3.8 Flash Next | `Vontra/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-MLX-4bit-MTP` | 113 GB | 192 GB or more |
| GLM-5.3-Flash | `Vontra/GLM-5.3-Flash-MLX-4bit-MTP` | 182 GB | 256 GB or more |

The main checkpoints come from the `Vontra` Hugging Face namespace; Qwen3.8-27B's optional DFlash2
drafter comes from `z-lab`.

```bash
tensorfold pull Vontra/Qwen3.8-27B-MLX-4bit z-lab/Qwen3.8-27B-DFlash2
tensorfold serve Vontra/Qwen3.8-27B-MLX-4bit
```

`serve` downloads a model it doesn't have yet; `pull` downloads ahead of time. Models go into the Hugging Face
cache (`~/.cache/huggingface`), and a local model directory works too. `tensorfold models` lists the families
and their checkpoints.

What each checkpoint needs:

- Qwen3.8 Flash Next drafts with the MTP head stored in its checkpoint, and its kernels read 4-bit weights in
  groups of 32. Use the `-MLX-4bit-MTP` conversion. TensorFold refuses other bit widths before downloading
  anything, and a conversion without the MTP head runs without drafts.
- Qwen3.8-27B drafts with the DFlash2 draft model once it has been pulled; `serve` picks it up automatically.
  Its lane kernels need 4-bit weights in groups of 64 and Metal 4 tensor units (M5-generation GPUs). On M1 to
  M4 GPUs, drafted windows of up to 8 rows go through TensorFold's row-exact matvec instead, so drafted output
  is still byte-identical to serial decoding. Each round drafts as many tokens as pay at the request's
  acceptance.
- GLM-5.3-Flash drafts with the MTP layer stored in its checkpoint, and its kernels read 4-bit weights in groups
  of 64. It needs MLX 0.32.2 or later on a 256 GB Mac: with 0.32.0, decoding there slowed to a few tokens a
  second after a few requests ([its recipe](docs/recipes/glm-5.3-flash.md#apple-silicon-mlx)).
- Nemotron 3.5 Lightning drafts with its MTP head, which the checkpoint above ships as `mtp-4bit.safetensors`
  (converted from NVIDIA's BF16 release; the standard MLX conversion drops it), and from the context.
  `pull` checks for the head, and `serve` completes an older cache that lacks it before loading.

Other checkpoints: `tensorfold info MODEL` says, from `config.json` alone, whether an engine here reads a
checkpoint's weights. A different conversion in a supported format runs with a note that it is untested; a model
or weight format with no recipe (NVFP4, GPTQ, AWQ and so on today) is refused before anything downloads. EXL3 is
read for GLM-5.3-Flash only, as an experiment (below).

to add yours, and [the runbook](RUNBOOK.md#your-own-model) has the steps.

## Speed

Decode speeds we measured through the server. They depend on content: copies of earlier text (file edits)
and predictable output (code, tool calls) draft well, fresh prose less so. The Nemotron rows predate its MTP
drafts, which are now on by default; in-engine they reached 217 tok/s on prose and 228 on code.

| Model | Machine | Workload | tok/s |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nemotron 3.5 Lightning, 4-bit | M5 Max, 128 GB | short answer with thinking | 188-206 (mlx_lm: 138) |
| | | about 20k-token context | 175 |
| | | about 60k-token context | 162 |
| Qwen3.8-27B, 4-bit, DFlash2 drafter | M5 Max, 128 GB | short answer with thinking | 120-124 (27 without drafts) |
| | | code | 189 (26 without drafts) |
| | M3 Ultra, 256 GB | code, 64 tokens | 141-158 (38-39 without drafts) |
| | | chat, 64 tokens | 74 (38-39 without drafts) |
| Qwen3.8 Flash Next, 4-bit | M3 Ultra, 256 GB | short answer with thinking | 105-107 (79 without drafts) |
| | | code | 112 (80 without drafts) |
| | | file edit | 190 |
| | | 18k-token context | 98.5 |
| | | 23k-token agent prompt, 512 thinking tokens, then a long tool call | 103-115 |
| GLM-5.3-Flash, 4-bit, up to 4 MTP drafts | M3 Ultra, 512 GB | short answer with thinking | 62.4 (46.9 without drafts) |
| | | code | 63.6 (47.1 without drafts) |
| | | file edit | 93.6 |
| | | 18k-token context | 48.0 |
| | | 23k-token agent prompt with tools, then a long tool call | 53.4 |

In 0.3.4, bench_openai's cells (64-token replies, thinking off, median of seeds; code sampled / chat sampled /
code greedy / chat greedy) gave Nemotron on the M5 Max 288 / 223 / 292 / 243 tok/s, against 173 / 173 / 179 / 176
for mlx_lm's own server through the same client. The 138 in the table above was TensorFold's older server
running mlx_lm's model, not mlx_lm itself.

## DGX Spark and other NVIDIA GPUs

![TensorFold CUDA Engine: exact decoding on DGX Spark, on Mac with Metal and on NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA](assets/tensorfold-cuda-banner.png)

On Linux with an NVIDIA GPU, `tensorfold serve` runs the family's CUDA engine (PyTorch, Triton and CUDA
kernels in `src/tensorfold/families/<name>/cuda/`). It reads the same MLX 4-bit checkpoints from Hugging Face.
Run it inside NVIDIA's PyTorch container, which has the CUDA toolkit, PyTorch and Triton the kernels build
with:

```bash
docker run -it --gpus all --ipc=host --network host -v ~/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface \
  nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:26.07-py3
pip install git+https://github.com/ashhart/TensorFold.git
tensorfold pull Vontra/Qwen3.8-27B-MLX-4bit z-lab/Qwen3.8-27B-DFlash2
tensorfold serve Vontra/Qwen3.8-27B-MLX-4bit --host 0.0.0.0
```

Two Sparks split a model between them over their direct link. Run the same command on each, rank 1 first, with
the address rank 0 has on that link. Rank 0 serves HTTP. The container also needs the network devices:

```bash
docker run -it --gpus all --ipc=host --network host --device /dev/infiniband --ulimit memlock=-1 \
  --cap-add IPC_LOCK -v ~/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:26.07-py3
tensorfold serve Vontra/Qwen3.8-27B-MLX-4bit --tp 2 --rank 1 --master 192.168.100.1   # on the second Spark
tensorfold serve Vontra/Qwen3.8-27B-MLX-4bit --tp 2 --rank 0 --master 192.168.100.1 --host 0.0.0.0
```

Set `NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME` and `NCCL_IB_HCA` to the link's interface and adapters if NCCL does not find them
([the runbook](RUNBOOK.md#dgx-spark) has the steps).

Measured on DGX Spark against vLLM with MTP=3 through the same OpenAI client: decode tok/s, one stream,
64-token replies, median of seeds 1234-1238, code and chat prompts, sampled (T 1, top-k 20, top-p 0.95) and
greedy. Each TensorFold number is byte-identical to its own serial decoding.

| Model | Sparks | Code, sampled | Chat, sampled | Code, greedy | Chat, greedy |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Qwen3.8-27B + DFlash2 | 1 | 49.6 vs 17.7 (2.8x) | 45.8 vs 15.0 (3.1x) | 49.2 vs 17.7 (2.8x) | 45.9 vs 17.0 (2.7x) |
| Qwen3.8-27B + DFlash2 | 2 | 82.4 vs 33.1 (2.5x) | 58.9 vs 30.4 (1.9x) | 76.2 vs 31.6 (2.4x) | 71.1 vs 30.5 (2.3x) |
| Qwen3.8 Flash Next | 1 | 68.3 vs 42.4 (1.6x) | 58.5 vs 33.2 (1.8x) | 73.1 vs 40.9 (1.8x) | 60.2 vs 37.6 (1.6x) |
| Qwen3.8 Flash Next | 2 | 103.8 vs 46.4 (2.2x) | 84.0 vs 41.4 (2.0x) | 96.2 vs 55.2 (1.7x) | 100.2 vs 50.7 (2.0x) |
| GLM-5.3-Flash | 2 | 49.4 vs 24.5 (2.0x) | 43.3 vs 24.3 (1.8x) | 66.3 vs 32.2 (2.1x) | 45.2 vs 24.7 (1.8x) |
| GLM-5.3-Flash, Mia-AiLab's EXL3 weights (experimental) | 2 | 36.4 vs 24.5 (1.5x) | 29.7 vs 24.3 (1.2x) | 43.8 vs 32.2 (1.4x) | 32.9 vs 24.7 (1.3x) |

On NVIDIA GPUs GLM-5.3-Flash needs two Sparks. For each greedy request it measures its MTP head against a DFlash2 draft model
and keeps whichever commits more tokens per millisecond ([its recipe](docs/recipes/glm-5.3-flash.md)). That draft
model, `incoai/GLM-5.3-Flash-DFlash2`, is licensed for non-commercial use only (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0); without it GLM
drafts with its MTP head alone. vLLM's GLM numbers come from Mia-AiLab's recipe, which serves the EXL3 checkpoint
`Mia-AiLab/GLM-5.3-Flash-EXL3-TR3-4bpw`. TensorFold now reads that checkpoint too, as an experiment; the table's
last row compares both engines on those same weights. It is slower than the MLX checkpoint because only its
routed experts are 4-bit, so each Spark reads 10.7 GB a token against 5.0
([its recipe](docs/recipes/glm-5.3-flash.md#mia-ailabs-exl3-checkpoint-experimental)). What we did on
CUDA, and how to bring up another model, is in [the CUDA recipe book](docs/recipes/cuda.md).

## Exact means byte-identical

Speculative decoding usually trades determinism for speed: drafted tokens are accepted by a random test, so the
same prompt and seed give different text depending on how drafting went. TensorFold keeps two guarantees
instead.

1. Every token is the model's own sample. The token at position `p` is the argmax over the top-k/top-p
   candidates of `logit / T + g(seed, p, token)`, with `g` Gumbel noise from a hash of the seed, the position
   and the token id. That is an exact draw from the top-k/top-p distribution, and it depends only on that row's
   logits and its position.
2. A row of a multi-row verify pass gets the same bits as a one-row step. The kernels are written so that a
   row's arithmetic does not depend on how many rows share the pass.

So a draft is accepted exactly when it equals the token one-token-at-a-time decoding would sample there, and
drafted decoding writes the same bytes as serial decoding. Drafts change speed only. You can check it yourself:
send the same request with `"draft": false`, which decodes one token a round, and compare.

The default seed is a hash of the prompt, so the same conversation gets the same reply. Pass `"seed"` to vary
it. One limit: for Flash Next, Nemotron and GLM-5.3-Flash on a Mac the prompt's cache can differ in its last bits
depending on which prefix was already cached, so a reply can too ([details](docs/recipes/README.md#a-known-limit)). Drafted and
serial decoding from the same cache always agree.

## Serve

```bash
tensorfold serve MODEL [options]    # MODEL: a Hugging Face repo id or a model directory
tensorfold pull REPO [REPO ...]      # download models or draft models
tensorfold models                   # families and the checkpoints they are tested with
tensorfold info MODEL               # which family serves a model (reads its config.json only)
tensorfold update                   # install the newest release from GitHub (--check: only say if there is one)
```

As it starts, `serve` asks GitHub whether a newer release exists (one request to api.github.com a day, with nothing
about you or your models in it) and prints a line if there is one; the server starts either way. `tensorfold
update` installs it with the same Python's pip and leaves MLX and PyTorch as they are unless the release needs
other versions. `--no-update-check` or `TENSORFOLD_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` switches the check off.

| Option | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--host`, `--port` | `127.0.0.1`, `8080` | where to listen (`--host 0.0.0.0` for other machines) |
| `--name`, `--alias` | the model's name | the model id clients send |
| `--context N` | the model's `max_position_embeddings` | prompt plus reply tokens a request may use; longer prompts get HTTP 400; `0` removes TensorFold's cap |
| `--max-tokens N` | 4096 | reply length when a request does not set `max_tokens` |
| `--temperature`, `--top-p`, `--top-k` | the model's `generation_config.json` | sampling defaults; `--temperature 0` is greedy |
| `--thinking` / `--no-thinking` | on | open a think block when the chat template supports one |
| `--reasoning-effort` | `medium` | for chat templates that take one (Qwen3.8) |
| `--thinking-budget N` | no limit | most thinking tokens before the server closes the think block |
| `--backend` | `auto` | `mlx` on macOS, `cuda` elsewhere |
| `--tp 2 --rank R --master HOST` | one GPU | split the model over two machines, one GPU each (CUDA; see [DGX Spark](#dgx-spark-and-other-nvidia-gpus)) |
| `--no-drafts` | off | one token a round: the serial reference |
| `--drafter` | `auto` | the family's draft model once pulled; a repo id or directory; or `none` |
| `--mtp-drafts N` | 3 (6 on CUDA) | most MTP drafts a round (Qwen3.8 Flash Next and, on a Mac, GLM-5.3-Flash, which pick each round's depth up to N from measured acceptance and window costs; on CUDA the chain also stops under 30% confidence); 0 turns MTP drafts off |
| `--no-update-check` | off | don't ask GitHub for a newer release at start |
| `--prompt-cache-gib` | an eighth of RAM, at most 16 | memory for cached conversation prefixes |
| `--snapshot-dir` | `~/.cache/tensorfold/prefix-snapshots` | system blocks and conversations kept across restarts |

Requests can override the sampling fields, the thinking switch and the budget. See [the API notes](docs/api.md)
for the fields TensorFold reads and what it returns.

By default, `serve` reads temperature, top-p and top-k from the checkpoint's `generation_config.json`; a
checkpoint with `do_sample: false` decodes greedily. CLI sampling flags override those values, and each
request can override them again. The context default comes from the checkpoint's `config.json`; large
windows still need enough memory for the actual prompt and reply.

## Prompt caching

Agent clients resend the whole conversation every turn. TensorFold keeps the caches of recent conversation
prefixes, so a follow-up only prefills its new suffix. It saves the system block, which a client sends with
every session, to disk once, so a new session starts without prefilling it. The newest conversations are saved
at shutdown and read back on demand.

cd TensorFold
pip install -e ".[test]"
pytest
```

The kernel tests of the lane engine need an M5-generation GPU and are skipped elsewhere. The CUDA engines'
tests in `tests/cuda/` run where PyTorch sees an NVIDIA GPU (inside NVIDIA's container: `pip install pytest`
first) and are skipped elsewhere.
