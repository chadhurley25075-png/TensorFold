# AI agent runbook

Use this when someone asks you to set up TensorFold and serve a model on their Mac. Run these commands in a
terminal on the Mac that will host the model. TensorFold uses MLX and Metal on Apple Silicon; the NVIDIA in
Nemotron's name refers to the model, not to a CUDA device. For a DGX Spark or another NVIDIA GPU, follow
[DGX Spark](#dgx-spark) instead.

## 1. Check the Mac and choose one model

```bash
uname -m
python3 --version
```

Continue when the architecture is `arm64` and Python is 3.11 or newer. If it is older and you use Homebrew,
run `brew install python`. Check available RAM and disk space before downloading a
checkpoint. Ask which model to use if the person has not picked one; download only that model and its
optional drafter.

| Model | Hugging Face repo | Download | Mac memory |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nemotron 3.5 Lightning | `Vontra/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3.5-Lightning-30B-A3B-MLX-4bit` | 18.6 GB | 32 GB or more |
| Qwen3.8-27B | `Vontra/Qwen3.8-27B-MLX-4bit` | 16.1 GB; optional drafter 3.8 GB | 32 GB or more |
| Qwen3.8 Flash Next | `Vontra/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-MLX-4bit-MTP` | 113 GB | 192 GB or more |
| GLM-5.3-Flash | `Vontra/GLM-5.3-Flash-MLX-4bit-MTP` | 182 GB | 256 GB or more, with MLX 0.32.2 or later |

These are the checkpoints this CLI is built and tested with. Qwen3.8-27B's fast lane kernels require an
M5-generation GPU; on older Apple Silicon Macs it uses MLX kernels instead. Allow extra disk space for the
Hugging Face cache and extra memory for context and runtime buffers. See the [model notes](README.md#models)
for checkpoint requirements.

## 2. Install the CLI

If the repository is not already on the Mac, clone it first. Then install into a virtual environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashhart/TensorFold.git
cd TensorFold
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e .
tensorfold --version
tensorfold models
```

If you already have a checkout, start at `cd` in that checkout and skip `git clone`. Keep the environment
active for the remaining commands. `tensorfold models` lists the supported repos and their kernel packages.

## 3. Pull the chosen model

Run the matching command below. A pull downloads the checkpoint into the Hugging Face cache, normally under
`~/.cache/huggingface/hub`. `serve` can also download a missing model, but a separate pull makes download
failures easier to spot.

Nemotron 3.5 Lightning:

```bash
tensorfold pull Vontra/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3.5-Lightning-30B-A3B-MLX-4bit
```

This repo includes `mtp-4bit.safetensors`, the converted Nemotron MTP draft head. `pull` checks that it
arrived and prints `required model files ready: mtp-4bit.safetensors`. A later `serve` also finishes an
older cache that has the model weights but lacks the head.

Qwen3.8-27B, with its optional DFlash2 drafter for faster decoding:

```bash
tensorfold pull Vontra/Qwen3.8-27B-MLX-4bit z-lab/Qwen3.8-27B-DFlash2
```

Qwen3.8 Flash Next:

```bash
tensorfold pull Vontra/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-MLX-4bit-MTP
```

GLM-5.3-Flash (on a 256 GB Mac, MLX 0.32.0 slows decoding down after a few requests; install 0.32.2 or later):

```bash
python -m pip install "mlx>=0.32.2"
tensorfold pull Vontra/GLM-5.3-Flash-MLX-4bit-MTP
```

For Qwen3.8-27B without the drafter, pull only its main repo. You can run `tensorfold info REPO_ID` to check
the detected family and kernel package; `info` fetches only `config.json` and does not pull model weights.

## 4. Start the server

Substitute the repo you pulled for `REPO_ID`:

```bash
tensorfold serve REPO_ID
```

Wait for TensorFold to print that it is serving at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1`. Leave that terminal running.
The default address accepts connections from this Mac. TensorFold takes the context limit from the model's
`config.json` and temperature, top-p and top-k from `generation_config.json`. The tested checkpoints each
advertise a 262,144-token context, but a long request needs enough memory to hold its cache. Use a smaller
cap such as `--context 8192` when appropriate; `--temperature`, `--top-p`, `--top-k` and `--max-tokens` can
set server defaults, and a request can override the sampling values and reply length. For Nemotron, check
that startup prints `Nemotron MTP head: active`; `inactive` means the head is present but drafting did not
activate because of flags or this MLX/GPU. Stop the server with Ctrl-C.

## 5. Check the endpoint

Use another terminal on the same Mac:

```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/models
```

Read the model ID from `/v1/models`. By default it is the final part of the repo ID, though `--name` can
change it. For the Nemotron checkpoint above, a chat request is:

```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"NVIDIA-Nemotron-3.5-Lightning-30B-A3B-MLX-4bit","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Say hello in one sentence."}],"max_tokens":128}'
```

For a different checkpoint, replace the `model` value with the ID returned by `/v1/models`. A successful
response has a `choices` array; reasoning, when enabled, may appear separately from the final answer.
Point an OpenAI-compatible client at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1` and use that same model ID. See the
[API notes](docs/api.md) for request fields and response details.

## Updating

`tensorfold serve` prints a line when a newer release is out. To install it:

```bash
tensorfold update            # or: tensorfold update --check, to only look
```

Restart the server afterwards. On a DGX Spark, a container started with `docker run --rm` loses anything
installed in it when it stops, so either run `pip install git+https://github.com/ashhart/TensorFold.git` again
in each new container, or keep a named container (`docker run --name tensorfold ...`, then `docker start -ai
tensorfold`) and run `tensorfold update` inside it.

## Your own model

TensorFold is built and tested with the checkpoints above (`tensorfold models` lists them). For anything else:

- `tensorfold info MODEL` reads only `config.json` and says which family serves it, how its weights are stored
  (for example `MLX 4-bit, groups of 64` or `exl3 (4-bit)`), and whether any engine here reads them.
- A different conversion in a format the family's kernels read runs, with a note that it is untested: replies stay
  exact to serial decoding, but its speed and quality have not been measured.
- A model type with no family, or weights in a format no engine reads (NVFP4, GPTQ, AWQ and so on today, and EXL3
  for anything but GLM-5.3-Flash), is refused before anything downloads, with a pointer to the recipe book.

Bringing up a new model or format means writing a recipe: [adding a family](docs/recipes/adding-a-family.md) on a
Mac, [adding a CUDA family](docs/recipes/adding-a-cuda-family.md) on NVIDIA GPUs, and the
[recipe book](docs/recipes/README.md) for how the existing ones were done. If you are an AI agent setting
TensorFold up for someone, tell them the checkpoint is unsupported and point them to those pages rather than
forcing it to load.

## If something fails

- `tensorfold: command not found`: activate `.venv` again in the current terminal.
- A download fails: check the exact repo ID, network access and free disk space, then rerun `tensorfold pull`.
- `info` works but `serve` still downloads: this is expected because `info` only needs the model config.
- The checkpoint is rejected: compare its quantization and draft head with the [model notes](README.md#models).
- A client cannot connect: keep `serve` running, check `/health`, and confirm its base URL and model ID.

## DGX Spark

TensorFold's CUDA engine serves Qwen3.8-27B (one or two Sparks), Qwen3.8 Flash Next (one or two Sparks) and
GLM-5.3-Flash (two Sparks; Mia-AiLab's EXL3 checkpoint of it as an experiment; on a Mac it needs one with 256 GB).
Nemotron 3.5 Lightning has no CUDA engine yet.

1. Check the GPU and start NVIDIA's PyTorch container, with the Hugging Face cache mounted so downloads
   survive the container:

   ```bash
   nvidia-smi
   docker run -it --gpus all --ipc=host --network host -v ~/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface \
     nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:26.07-py3
   ```

2. Inside the container, install, pull and serve:

   ```bash
   pip install git+https://github.com/ashhart/TensorFold.git
   tensorfold pull Vontra/Qwen3.8-27B-MLX-4bit z-lab/Qwen3.8-27B-DFlash2
   tensorfold serve Vontra/Qwen3.8-27B-MLX-4bit --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
   ```

   The first start compiles the kernels (a minute or two); later starts reuse them while the container lives.
   Check the endpoint as in step 5 above, with the model ID from `/v1/models`.

3. Two Sparks. Connect them with a cable between their 200 Gb/s ports and give each port an address. Start
   the container on both with the network devices added:

   ```bash
   docker run -it --gpus all --ipc=host --network host --device /dev/infiniband --ulimit memlock=-1 \
     --cap-add IPC_LOCK -v ~/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:26.07-py3
   ```

   Install and pull on both (both ranks need the model and its draft model). Find the link's interface and
   adapters with `ibdev2netdev` and set them in both containers when NCCL does not pick them itself:

   ```bash
   export NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=enp1s0f1np1 NCCL_IB_HCA=rocep1s0f1,roceP2p1s0f1   # examples: use your names
   ```

   Then start rank 1 on the second Spark and rank 0 on the first, both with rank 0's address on the link:

   ```bash
   tensorfold serve Vontra/Qwen3.8-27B-MLX-4bit --tp 2 --rank 1 --master 192.168.100.1
   tensorfold serve Vontra/Qwen3.8-27B-MLX-4bit --tp 2 --rank 0 --master 192.168.100.1 --host 0.0.0.0
   ```

   Rank 0 serves HTTP once both have loaded. The ranks refuse to start when they were given different settings
   (for example the draft model present on one Spark only).

If a two-Spark start hangs at the rendezvous, check that each Spark can reach the other's address on the link
and that the port (`--master-port`, default 29551) is open. GLM-5.3-Flash has its own setup steps in
[its recipe](docs/recipes/glm-5.3-flash.md).
