# GLM-5.3-Flash (`glm5_next`)

GLM-5.3-Flash runs on two DGX Sparks through TensorFold's CUDA engine, tensor parallel: the 4-bit checkpoint is
182 GB and one Spark has 128 GB. On a Mac with 256 GB or more it runs on the MLX engine, on one machine:
[Apple Silicon (MLX)](#apple-silicon-mlx), at the end.

The sections before that one were measured on two Sparks (GB10, 128 GB unified memory each) linked by their
200 Gb/s ports, in NVIDIA's `pytorch:26.07-py3` container. Package: `src/tensorfold/families/glm5_next/`
(`cuda/` holds the engine). Checkpoint: `Vontra/GLM-5.3-Flash-MLX-4bit-MTP` (MLX affine 4-bit, groups of 64,
with the MTP layer). Draft model: `incoai/GLM-5.3-Flash-DFlash2`. Mia-AiLab's EXL3 checkpoint also runs, as an
experiment ([below](#mia-ailabs-exl3-checkpoint-experimental)).

## Run it

Set up both Sparks as in the [runbook](../../RUNBOOK.md#dgx-spark) (the container with the network devices, NCCL
pointed at the link), then on each:

```bash
tensorfold pull Vontra/GLM-5.3-Flash-MLX-4bit-MTP
tensorfold pull incoai/GLM-5.3-Flash-DFlash2        # optional, non-commercial (below)
```

The checkpoint is MIT-licensed. The DFlash2 draft model is optional and licensed CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 (non-commercial,
no derivatives), so pull it only if those terms fit your use. Without it GLM drafts with its MTP head only, and the
default policy uses `c3:0.35` for greedy requests and `a:0.6:0.85` for sampled ones (their rows in the tables
below).

Start rank 1 on the second Spark, then rank 0 on the first; both take rank 0's address on the link:

```bash
tensorfold serve Vontra/GLM-5.3-Flash-MLX-4bit-MTP --tp 2 --rank 1 --master 192.168.100.1
tensorfold serve Vontra/GLM-5.3-Flash-MLX-4bit-MTP --tp 2 --rank 0 --master 192.168.100.1 --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

Each rank reads its half of every layer straight from the pulled checkpoint (`cuda/split.py` has the rules) and
holds 90.8 GB. Loading took about 155 s a rank from a folder holding only its half (below). A first start also
compiles the kernels. Through this package, with an empty kernel cache, both ranks were ready 202 to 228 s after
starting. Read from the full checkpoint, a rank reads about a third more, because the halves of the down
projections interleave. The ranks compare their settings before loading and refuse to start when they differ, for
example when the draft model was pulled on one Spark only (pull it on both, or pass `--drafter none` to both).

A Spark short on disk can write its half once (about 91 GB) and serve that folder instead of the checkpoint:

```bash
python -m tensorfold.families.glm5_next.cuda.split ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--Vontra--GLM-5.3-Flash-MLX-4bit-MTP/snapshots/<revision> --rank 1 glm-rank1
tensorfold serve glm-rank1 --tp 2 --rank 1 --master 192.168.100.1
```

### Draft policies

Every reply is byte-identical to serial decoding on the same two ranks whatever the policy; the policy only
changes the speed. The default, `auto`, depends on the request's temperature:

- Greedy: each round drafts with the checkpoint's MTP head (up to 3 drafts while their probabilities' product
  stays at or above 0.35, `c3:0.35`) or with DFlash2 (up to 5, `fc5:0.3`). The engine starts with two rounds
  of each, then keeps the drafter that has committed more tokens per millisecond in this request, switches when
  the other is 3% ahead, and gives the other one round every 8 to keep its count current. The milliseconds are
  a verify window of each size, an MTP draft and a DFlash2 block, timed at load and the same on both Sparks, so
  both make the same choice. On the benchmark's greedy code prompt about half the rounds end up on DFlash2, on
  the chat prompt about 40%.
- Sampled: 1 to 3 MTP drafts a round, the number set by the running acceptance (`a:0.6:0.85`). DFlash2's sampled
  chains measured slower here.

Without the draft model, greedy requests use `c3:0.35`. A request can ask for another policy after an `@` in its
model name, for example `"model": "GLM-5.3-Flash-MLX-4bit-MTP@c3:0.35"`:

| Spec | Drafts a round |
| --- | --- |
| `auto` | the default above |
| `auto:E:EVERY:MARGIN` | the same choice with E rounds of each first, one round of the other every EVERY rounds and a MARGIN to switch, for sampled requests too |
| `0` | none (serial) |
| `N` | N MTP drafts |
| `a` or `a:LOW:HIGH` | 1 to 3 MTP drafts: 1 while the running acceptance is under LOW, 2 under HIGH, else 3 |
| `cN:P` | up to N MTP drafts while the product of the drafts' own probabilities stays at or above P |
| `fN`, `fcN:P`, `fa:...` | the same with DFlash2 drafts (needs the draft model on both Sparks) |

`--mtp-drafts N` sets a fixed default, `--no-drafts` serves serially, and `"draft": false` in a request decodes
that one serially (the reference the drafted replies equal). `"ignore_eos": true` decodes `max_tokens` tokens
past an end-of-sequence token, as the benchmarks below do.

The engine keeps the committed state after the last request's prompt and after its reply. A prompt that extends
either (the next turn of a conversation) resumes from it instead of prefilling from the start, with the same
bits as a fresh prefill.

## What decides the speed

- 45 decoder layers over a hidden size of 4,096: 34 Kimi delta attention (KDA) layers (64 heads of 128, a gated
  delta rule with a per-channel decay) and 11 DeepSeek sparse attention (DSA) layers (MLA with a 1,536 query
  rank and a 512 latent, plus an indexer that keeps the best 2,048 keys in pools of 4).
- The first 3 layers have a dense MLP (12,288 wide); the other 42 route each token to 8 of 288 experts (2,048
  wide) plus a shared expert.
- Four residual streams mixed by manifold-constrained hyper-connections (a 24-way mix, 20 Sinkhorn steps).
- Vocabulary 154,880, and one extra decoder layer as the MTP head.
- Each rank reads about 5.0 GB a token: experts 2.68 GB, KDA 1.46, DSA 0.39, dense MLP 0.13, router and
  hyper-connections 0.17, its half of the head 0.18.

## Against vLLM

Decode tokens per second after the first token, one stream, 64-token replies, through the same OpenAI client
(`tools/bench_openai.py`) for both engines. Each cell is the median of five seeds, 1234 to 1238, after a warm-up
request. Code prompt: "Write a short Python function that computes the Fibonacci sequence and explain it." as a
raw completion. Chat prompt: "Explain how matrix multiplication uses a GPU in plain English, then give a small
numerical example." through the chat template with thinking off. Sampled means temperature 1, top-k 20, top-p
0.95.

The baseline is vLLM serving `Mia-AiLab/GLM-5.3-Flash-EXL3-TR3-4bpw` (EXL3 4 bpw experts, fp8 KV cache) tensor
parallel over the same two Sparks, through that recipe's own launch script: with MTP at 3 drafts, and with its
default DFlash2 at 7 drafts. Its drafted output is not byte-identical to its serial output. Ours is: every
in-engine run compares the drafted token ids with serial decoding on the same engine by SHA-256.

TensorFold ran from this package, installed with pip in NVIDIA's container on both Sparks and started as above from
folders holding each rank's half, with its default policy (`auto`). The numbers come from one session on 26
September (11:59 to 12:03 UTC) with the decoding code that ships, before the release validation. The validation's
own session gave the same chat-sampled, code-greedy and chat-greedy medians within 1% (43.3, 66.8, 44.8), but page
migration slowed the sampled-code runs of every policy there, and a rerun's measured pass as well (Slow runs on
GB10, below).

| | Code, sampled | Chat, sampled | Code, greedy | Chat, greedy |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| vLLM, MTP=3 | 24.5 | 24.3 | 32.2 | 24.7 |
| vLLM, DFlash2 at 7 drafts | 22.2 | 21.5 | 28.8 | 22.6 |
| TensorFold, default policy (`auto`) | 49.4 | 43.3 | 66.3 | 45.2 |
| TensorFold / vLLM MTP=3 | 2.02x | 1.78x | 2.06x | 1.83x |

Serial decoding (`--no-drafts`) ran at 31.2 to 33.8 tok/s per cell in two earlier sessions with the same kernels.

Single runs vary a lot at temperature 1 because the reply is a function of the seed. The default policy ran at
33.5 to 55.9 tok/s over the five code seeds, which is why the tables use medians.

### Per-cell policies

A request can name another policy (above). These are the policies measured for this recipe, in the same session
as the table above. The best policy in each column was picked from these four on the same prompts and seeds it is
scored on, so the last row is a best case for this benchmark, not a prediction for new prompts.

| Policy | Code, sampled | Chat, sampled | Code, greedy | Chat, greedy |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `auto`, the default | 49.4 | 43.3 | 66.3 | 45.2 |
| `a:0.6:0.85`, MTP only | 49.3 | 43.2 | 52.9 | 40.9 |
| `c3:0.35` | 46.1 | 45.2 | 57.8 | 37.2 |
| `fc5:0.3`, DFlash2 drafts | 45.6 | 43.9 | 67.3 | 42.2 |
| Best in the column / vLLM MTP=3 | 2.02x | 1.86x | 2.09x | 1.83x |

Slow runs pulled down two greedy-chat medians here: `c3:0.35` lost three of its five runs to them (its others
reached 44.4 to 44.8) and `fc5:0.3` two (42.5 to 42.7). The default is the best or within 1.5% of it in three
columns. On sampled chat `c3:0.35` beat it by 4% in this session and trailed it in two earlier ones (41.1 and 42.3
against 43.2), because its seed 1237 run swung between 39.6 and 45.2 from session to session.

## Mia-AiLab's EXL3 checkpoint (experimental)

`Mia-AiLab/GLM-5.3-Flash-EXL3-TR3-4bpw` is the checkpoint vLLM serves in the baseline above. Its routed experts
are stored in ExLlamaV3's EXL3 format (a 4-bit trellis with the "mcg" codebook). Every other weight is BF16: the
attention, the shared expert, the dense layers and the head. It is 164 GB on disk against the MLX checkpoint's
182 GB, but a token reads more of it: about 10.7 GB on each Spark against 5.0, because every token reads all the
BF16 weights and only 8 of the 288 experts. Reading it is experimental. It passes the same exactness checks as the
MLX checkpoint, but it has had one validation session, and speed work on it has only started.

Pull it on both Sparks and start it the same way:

```bash
tensorfold pull Mia-AiLab/GLM-5.3-Flash-EXL3-TR3-4bpw
tensorfold serve Mia-AiLab/GLM-5.3-Flash-EXL3-TR3-4bpw --tp 2 --rank 1 --master 192.168.100.1
tensorfold serve Mia-AiLab/GLM-5.3-Flash-EXL3-TR3-4bpw --tp 2 --rank 0 --master 192.168.100.1 --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

Each rank holds 88.6 GB. Through this package, with an empty kernel cache, both ranks were ready 297 s after
starting. With the DFlash2 draft model pulled on both Sparks, the default policy (`auto`) drafts with DFlash2
(`fc5:0.3`) for every request, because on these weights that policy was the best or tied in all four cells.
Without the draft model, `auto` works as it does on the MLX checkpoint.

Measured as in the table above, against vLLM serving the same checkpoint through Mia-AiLab's recipe. TensorFold ran
from this package, installed with pip in NVIDIA's container on both Sparks, on 26 September (20:01 to 20:02 UTC):

| | Code, sampled | Chat, sampled | Code, greedy | Chat, greedy |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| vLLM, MTP=3 | 24.5 | 24.3 | 32.2 | 24.7 |
| TensorFold, EXL3 checkpoint, `auto` | 36.4 | 29.7 | 43.8 | 32.9 |
| TensorFold / vLLM MTP=3 | 1.48x | 1.22x | 1.36x | 1.33x |

What it took:

- `cuda/exl3.py` defines the format and a reference decoder. It matched ExLlamaV3's own dequantization bit for
  bit on 12 of 12 expert matrices from the checkpoint.
- `cuda/exl3.cu` decodes each 16x16 tile of the trellis straight into tensor-core fragments and runs the
  Hadamard rotations around it as warp butterflies in fp32. A layer's routed experts read at 208 to 220 GB/s
  at 1 to 8 rows; ExLlamaV3's own kernel reads the same experts at 127 to 158 GB/s on GB10. Each row's result
  is bit-identical at any window width.
- The other weights run through a row-invariant BF16 matmul.
- Draft steps use a 4-bit copy of the BF16 head, while verification keeps the BF16 head, so replies do not
  change. An MTP draft went from 4.3 to 2.4 ms and a DFlash2 block from 5.2 to 3.3 ms.

Exactness on the full model across both Sparks:

- In the engine, 20 of 20 drafted replies equal to serial decoding: `auto`, `a:0.6:0.85`, `c3:0.35`, `fc5:0.3` and
  `2`, on both prompts, greedy and seed 1234.
- Through this package's server: 12 of 12 replies of the default policy equal to serial decoding by token-id
  SHA-256 (both benchmark prompts, greedy and seeds 1234 to 1238); 9 of 9 drafted replies equal to the same
  requests sent with `"draft": false`; prompts resumed from a kept reply or prompt equal to fresh prefills.
- `tests/cuda/test_glm_exl3.py` checks the codebook and tile order, the decoder bit by bit, that each layer's
  two-rank split adds up to the whole, and that the BF16 matmul and the expert kernel keep every row independent
  of the others and match their references. `tests/cuda/test_glm_engine.py` runs a synthetic EXL3 checkpoint
  through the engine: drafted replies equal serial ones, and resumed prompts equal fresh prefills.

A verify window takes about 57 ms at 1 row and 91 ms at 8, against 29 and 69 ms on the MLX checkpoint; the BF16
weights are most of the difference. The next steps are storing the BF16 weights losslessly in fewer bits, tuning
the BF16 matmul, and a drafter that gets more tokens right a round. Not checked on this checkpoint: contexts past
2,051 tokens. Other EXL3 checkpoints are refused: the engine reads 4-bit mcg-codebook routed experts with BF16
elsewhere, and nothing else.

## Slow runs on GB10

Some runs came in well under the speed the same request reached in other runs, with no other job on either Spark.
Counting a run as slow below 85% of the best run of the same request, 19 of the 120 runs in the first release
session were slow, at 41 to 81% of that speed, and 20 of 200 in two earlier sessions with the same kernels. That
session measured `a:0.6:0.85`, then the default, three times:

| `a:0.6:0.85` | Code, sampled | Chat, sampled | Code, greedy | Chat, greedy |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| First pass | 31.0 | 43.2 | 52.0 | 37.5 |
| Rerun, pass 1 | 49.0 | 43.2 | 52.3 | 40.9 |
| Rerun, pass 2 | 49.2 | 43.0 | 34.8 | 40.7 |

Slow runs moved the first pass's medians for sampled code and greedy chat, and pass 2's for greedy code. Runs that
were not slow matched the earlier sessions seed for seed, within a median of 0.1 to 0.5% for each policy. In the
final release validation, two or three of the five sampled-code runs were slow in every policy's pass.

During two reruns, a sampler on each Spark recorded once a second the GPU's SM clock, its active clock event
reasons and its power, and the kernel's `pgmigrate_success` and `compact_stall` counters from `/proc/vmstat`. All
four slow stretches fell inside bursts of page migration (4 KB pages):

| Slow stretch | Runs slowed | Migrated, first Spark | Migrated, second Spark |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| First session, 1 | 2 of 5 greedy code runs | 0.19 GB | 1.25 GB |
| First session, 2 | 4 of 5 greedy code runs and 1 greedy chat run | 1.51 GB | 0.77 GB |
| Final tree, 1 | 2 of 5 sampled chat runs, at 22 and 32 tok/s | 0.30 GB | 0 |
| Final tree, 2 | the last sampled code run, 44.6 against 49.4 | 0 | 1.57 GB |

Outside those stretches, neither Spark migrated more than 40 MB in a second. During them GPU power dropped on both
Sparks, so the GPUs sat waiting: a stall on one rank holds the other at the next all-gather. The SM clock stayed
at 2.4 to 2.6 GHz with no clock event reason active, and direct-compaction stalls rose by 7 at most. So the slow
runs are not clock throttling, and page migration is the likely cause. What starts the migrations is not known;
the runs changed no system setting. Dropping the page cache after loading made it worse (Tried and rejected,
below).

A median of five hides two slow runs in a greedy cell, where the five replies are identical. In a sampled cell one
slow run can move the median, because the seeds differ in speed. Run a cell again when its greedy runs disagree,
or when a seed runs slower than it did in another pass.

## What paid

| Step | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| A row-invariant 4-bit matmul in Triton (a tensor-core dot per 64-input group, then scale and bias, groups in order, the K split fixed by the weight's shape) on words regrouped once at load | exact windows; dense matmuls near the memory's read rate |
| Grouped expert kernels: every distinct expert of a window read once, each (row, expert) pair computed with the same bits whatever the other rows; GLM's limited SwiGLU in the gate/up epilogue | a verify row costs only the experts it adds, 6 to 10 ms |
| Expert kernels at 2 groups a step and 2 stages (same bits) | a MoE layer 12% faster at 1 row, 18% at 4 rows |
| KDA as one kernel per layer and window (one block a head runs the chain of rows), and one launch that replays every layer's kept prefix at commit | exact KDA windows, no per-row launches |
| The router's logits in 8 K slices added in order (72 programs for 288 experts instead of 5) | 23.4 to 12.8 us a call |
| K splits and launch settings per matmul shape, each timed on distinct weight copies so caches cannot help | dense matmuls 11.05 to 9.73 ms a one-row forward; with the router's slices, serial 31.8 to 33.8 tok/s |
| CUDA graphs per window size, the all-gathers captured with them | serial step 29.6 ms |
| The checkpoint's MTP head read with vLLM's convention (the final-normed hidden row, not the streams' mean before the norm) | next-token agreement 0.739 against 0.696 |
| DFlash2 at 4 bits on the engine's matmul, its attention in a Triton kernel (PyTorch's SDPA with a mask fell back to fp32 math), both ranks drafting with half of it | a block of drafts in 3.7 to 4.2 ms; best on greedy code |
| The drafter chosen per greedy request (`auto`), with both drafters' caches kept current: a drafter that sat out takes the committed rows it missed when it next drafts | against `a:0.6:0.85` alone in one session: greedy code 52.9 to 66.3, greedy chat 40.9 to 45.2 tok/s; sampled the same |

## Tried and rejected

- MTP drafts over the first 32,768 token ids (a smaller draft head): 8.7% of the reply tokens have larger ids.
- MTP drafts sampled at 0.7 times the temperature: no gain.
- DFlash2 in bf16: slightly more accepted on chat, but its block took 7.5 ms.
- Other launch settings for the 16-row matmuls, other hyper-connection K splits, more K slices everywhere: within
  noise.
- NCCL channel and rail settings: none beat the defaults (an all-gather captured in a CUDA graph takes about
  28 us against 17 us eager).
- Dropping the page cache after loading: it set off about 25 GB of page migration during the benchmark.
- The same per-request choice for sampled requests: 2 to 4% slower than MTP drafts alone on the sampled cells,
  because DFlash2 rounds lost 8% on two of the five code seeds. On these prompts even a perfect choice per
  seed would not move the sampled medians: the median seed is one where MTP wins.
- Timing each drafter piece once at load: a slow moment right after loading put a DFlash2 block at 9 ms
  (about 3 ms in rounds) and the choice kept greedy code on MTP. Each piece is now timed in turns over several
  passes and keeps its fastest run.

## Exactness

Checked on the full model across both Sparks:

- Serial steps against verify windows of 2 to 8 rows, with full and partial keeps and other prefill chunkings:
  87 of 87 rows bit-identical.
- CUDA-graph steps against eager steps: 24 of 24 windows and 4 of 4 MTP steps bit-identical.
- Every drafted decode (MTP and DFlash2 policies, sampled and greedy, both prompts) equal to serial decoding by
  token-id SHA-256. Greedy hashes: code `9c65654e926ec8fb`, chat `b6d1267266302457`.
- Against a reference forward on dequantized weights, 150 teacher-forced tokens: top-1 agreement 97.3%, NLL
  0.947 against 0.963 (its matmuls ran in TF32 in NVIDIA's container).
- Through this package's server, on the final code: 9 of 9 drafted replies equal to the same requests sent with
  `"draft": false` (code, chat and JSON prompts, 96 tokens, seeds 1234 and 1235 and greedy); 12 of 12 replies of
  the default policy equal to serial decoding by token-id SHA-256 (both benchmark prompts, greedy and seeds 1234
  to 1238), the greedy ones with the hashes above; prompts resumed from a kept reply or prompt equal to fresh
  prefills.

The kernel tests (`tests/cuda/test_glm_kernels.py`) check row invariance of every kernel on synthetic weights and
compare with torch definitions computed in float64. `tests/cuda/test_glm_engine.py` runs the whole engine on a
synthetic two-layer checkpoint with a one-layer synthetic draft model: drafted replies equal serial ones for every
policy, including the drafter choice made to switch every round, and resumed prompts equal fresh prefills. The
container sets `TORCH_ALLOW_TF32_CUBLAS_OVERRIDE=1`, which makes fp32 matmuls TF32 and would loosen fp32 references
past the tests' tolerances.

## Limits

- Two Sparks only, one request at a time.
- Contexts up to 2,051 tokens were measured: below that DSA's indexer keeps every key, so attention is dense.
  `--context N` on both ranks takes longer contexts (DSA's sparse top-k, eager past 2,051 tokens, about 0.4 MB
  of cache a token on each rank). That path was checked only on a truncated model (layers 0 to 3 and the MTP
  layer, one GPU, a 2,300-token sequence): 99.6% top-1 agreement with the reference past 2,050 tokens, verify
  windows bit-identical to serial steps (21 of 21 rows), MTP-drafted decoding equal to serial. The full model on
  two Sparks, DFlash2 or `auto` drafts, and prefix reuse past 2,051 tokens were not checked, and its speed was
  not measured.
- A request whose prompt plus `max_tokens` needs more context than the server was started for gets an HTTP 400
  naming the `--context` to restart both ranks with. Without `max_tokens`, a reply stops where the context ends.
- A client that disconnects does not stop its reply early; both ranks finish it.
- On GB10, bursts of page migration can slow a run to half speed or less (Slow runs on GB10, above).

## Where the time goes

Timed at load through the whole two-rank step (CUDA graphs and all-gathers included, the fastest of 7 runs), a
verify window takes 29.2, 38.9, 45.2, 55.2, 59.5, 63.2, 65.6 and 69.2 ms at 1 to 8 rows; an MTP draft with its
sampling 1.7 ms and each further chained draft 1.5 ms; a DFlash2 block with its host chain 3.2 ms. A one-row step
takes 29.6 ms on each rank: routed and shared experts 13.4 ms (near the read rate), dense 4-bit
matmuls about 9.7 ms, 90 all-gathers about 2.4 ms, hyper-connections and KDA chains about 2.2 ms. Every extra
verify row costs 6 to 10 ms, almost all of it the experts that row adds, so acceptance decides the rest: the MTP
head's first draft is right 70 to 96% of the time and its third 10 to 36%. About half of an MTP draft step is
the 154,880-row head. The next things to try: picking drafts on the GPU without a host round trip per
step, a smaller head for drafts only, and verify trees with a second candidate at the first position.

## Apple Silicon (MLX)

The same checkpoint on one Mac, through the lane engine's family rounds (`engine/lane_family.py`, as Flash Next)
with MTP drafts. Package: `src/tensorfold/families/glm5_next/` (`model.py` forward pass, `mtp.py` draft head,
`runtime.py` what the engine drives: `hidden` / `head` / `keep_rows`, `speculate` / `settle` for the head, the
load-time window check); Metal kernels `v1` in `src/tensorfold/kernels/glm/flash/v1/`. Measured on two M3 Ultra Mac Studios, one
with 512 GB (MLX 0.32.0) and one with 256 GB (MLX 0.32.2). Contributed by Chad Hurley, following this recipe book.

```bash
pip install "mlx>=0.32.2"          # on a 256 GB Mac, see the traps below
tensorfold pull Vontra/GLM-5.3-Flash-MLX-4bit-MTP
tensorfold serve Vontra/GLM-5.3-Flash-MLX-4bit-MTP                    # up to 3 MTP drafts a round, the depth
                                                                      # from measured acceptance and window costs
tensorfold serve Vontra/GLM-5.3-Flash-MLX-4bit-MTP --mtp-drafts 1     # one draft a round
```

The process holds about 170 GB and keeps its weights wired. Loading took 29 to 39 s from a warm file cache. The
DFlash2 draft model is used by the CUDA engine only; on a Mac GLM drafts with its MTP head, and `serve` may print
that the draft model is not pulled, which does not matter here.

### What decides the speed

The architecture is above (What decides the speed). On a Mac, one row reads about 9 GB of 4-bit weights a token:
experts about 5.3 GB (8 routed and the shared one, 42 layers), KDA about 2.6 GB, sparse attention about 0.7 GB,
the head and the rest the remainder.
MLX's own one-row 4-bit matvec reaches about 630 GB/s on these shapes on an M3 Ultra, so the floor is about 14.5 ms
a token. Before fusion the step took about 36 ms with about 3,600 kernels a token: the gap was kernel count, as the
recipe book's method predicts.

What is specific to this family:

- KDA keeps a recurrent state (64 heads of 128 x 128, fp32) and a width-4 conv window, so a rejected draft cannot
  just be trimmed. The decode call keeps its entry state and inputs, and `keep_rows` replays the kept prefix
  through the same kernel. The state after a partial keep is bit-identical to stepping one row at a time, so
  drafting is not limited to one draft.
- The checkpoint is affine 4-bit in groups of 64. Flash Next's kernels read groups of 32, so `qmv_rows` and the
  expert kernels were re-indexed for 64.
- MLA's `kv_b_proj` stays as stored (quantized along the 512 latent) and is applied per head: keys absorbed into
  the query, values after attention. Nothing is quantized a second time. After layer 44 the hidden state is 0.76%
  (relative L2) from a float32 forward of the same stored weights; re-quantizing `kv_b` per head along the other
  axis measured 2.98%.
- The MTP layer is `layers.45` (DeepSeek-V3 style): `eh_proj` over the next token's embedding and the backbone's
  hidden state (streams collapsed, before the final norm), then a plain MLA + MoE block without hyper-connections.
  Its drafts chain from its own output.

### What paid

Step times are the full model at 4,096 keys, medians of 18 steps, settings alternated in one process.

| Step | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| A forward written from the checkpoint layout, checked sublayer by sublayer against mlx-vlm's `glm5_next` (as oMLX vendors it) on the real weights | the reference; its prefill path is op for op mlx-vlm's |
| `qmv_rows` for groups of 64 (strategy B), and one-launch row kernels for the router, the routed experts (each distinct expert read once a window), the hyper-connection mix, the indexer gate and KDA's small `f_b` / `g_b` (MLX's `qmv_quad`) | exact windows; 8 layers at 8 rows 30.3 to 20.0 ms, at 16 rows 57.3 to 34.7 ms |
| KDA's whole decode step in one kernel a layer (ported from mlx-vlm #2105), the rows of a window in order inside the launch, `f_b` / `g_b` folded in | about 35 dispatches a KDA layer to 3; 45-layer estimate 37.0 to 33.7 ms |
| Sparse attention reading the chosen latent keys from the cache by index (ported from mlx-vlm #2245), the capacity a runtime stride | no gathered key copy, no recompile as the cache grows |
| The MoE block in five kernels (router reading the stored bf16 once, route + group, gate/up + SwiGLU, down, combine), a hyper-connection boundary in three, MLA's projections that read the same input stacked; all strategy B | 35.7 to 27.1 ms, logits unchanged |
| `mx.async_eval` every 2 layers (`TF_GLM5_EVAL_EVERY`) | 27.2 to 22.7 ms |
| The shared expert in kernels of its own that read only x, so it runs beside the latency-bound router | 1 / 2 / 4 rows 22.7 / 29.8 / 45.9 to 22.4 / 29.1 / 44.2 ms |
| The draft depth from each draft position's own acceptance and the measured verify cost of each depth (the lane engine's rule since 0.3.4, `window_costs` measured at load; `depth_for` before it) | the second chained draft lands 0.60 to 0.69 against 0.81 to 0.87 for the first, so the policy stays at one draft unless chained drafts land well |

Kernels a token went from 3,578 to 1,197 (graph nodes 6,925 to 1,750). Everything in the table but the two ports is
strategy B and left serial decoding's logits bit-identical. The two ports are strategy C: they set the decode
path's arithmetic, checked against float32 (Exactness, below).

### Speed

Through the server, one request at a time, decode tok/s from the first to the last streamed token, T 1.0 and top-p
0.95. The same kinds of request as the Flash Next table: a short answer with thinking (25-token prompt), code (45),
a file edit (a rename in a 5k-character file, a 1,922-token reply), an 18k-token context, and a 23k-token agent
prompt with 6 tools ending in a long tool call. M3 Ultra, 512 GB, MLX 0.32.0. Every drafted reply is byte-identical
to the same request with `"draft": false`.

| Request | serial | 1 draft | `--mtp-drafts 4` |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| short answer | 46.9 | 60.6 | 62.4 |
| code | 47.1 | 64.3 | 63.6 |
| file edit | 43.1 | 94.1 | 93.6 |
| 18k-token context | 42.2 | 47.9 | 48.0 |
| 23k-token agent prompt | 42.1 | 53.7 | 53.4 |

For reference, oMLX 0.7.0.dev2 with its DFlash2 drafter, which served this model on the same Mac before, ran the
same prompts at 46.2, 58.8, 82.4, 31.3 and 45.1 tok/s. On the 256 GB Studio (MLX 0.32.2, one draft), another set of
short, code, thinking, 18k and 23k-agent prompts ran at 62.0, 63.1, 60.1, 47.7 and 48.4 tok/s.

Fixed depths, the same prompts (tok/s):

| Request | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| short answer | 59.4 | 58.6 | 52.1 | 41.7 |
| code | 63.5 | 57.1 | 48.4 | 38.9 |
| file edit | 90.8 | 91.3 | 90.3 | 89.8 |
| 18k-token context | 47.6 | 41.0 | 33.2 | 27.0 |
| 23k-token agent prompt | 52.8 | 47.7 | 41.1 | 33.5 |

A round of 1 to 4 drafts took 31.8, 40.5, 49.9 and 62.7 ms: each extra verify row costs 8 to 10 ms, most of it the
experts it adds. File edits draft from copy windows, where depth hardly matters.

### On 0.3.4: the lane engine's family rounds (256 GB M3 Ultra, MLX 0.32.2, `--context 1048576`)

The serial engine left in 0.3.4, so the runtime now speaks `engine/lane_family.py`'s contract (as Flash Next):
`exact_width` and `window_costs` measured at load, `speculate` / `settle` for the head with the chained drafts left
on the GPU, one-step-ahead rounds for `"draft": false`, the engine's own depth rule from the measured costs.

- Load-time check on the real weights: every window up to 16 rows exact. Forward ms by width 1: 20.7, 2: 28.0,
  3: 36.5, 4: 45.8, 8: 84.2, 16: 159.4 (8.6 ms an extra row); the head's chained step 1.28 ms; loaded in 45 s.
- Drafted replies byte-identical to `"draft": false` on 15 of 15 cases: 6 greedy, 6 seeded (T 0.6 to 1.0 with
  top-p / top-k), a tool call and its result leg, a 32K-token context; content, reasoning and the assembled tool
  calls compared.
- Decode through the server, T 0, 200-token replies: 55 to 57 tok/s (drafted; 48.7 serial), 65 on a short
  arithmetic answer, 48.5 / 41.7 at 32K context. Prefill 317 tok/s at 8K and 263 at 32K, cold.
- `TF_FAMILY_PROFILE=1`: a round of 2.5 rows spends ~36 ms on the GPU and 3 ms building its graph
  (`TF_GLM5_EVAL_EVERY=0` separates the two; with the default 2 the host time shown is command-buffer submission).
  The rounds are GPU-bound. `TF_GLM5_EVAL_EVERY` 1 / 2 / 4 and `--mtp-drafts` 1 / 3 all land within 2 tok/s of each
  other; `TF_GLM_MTP_NORMED=1` (the head reads the final-normed hidden row, as the CUDA engine found useful)
  moved first-draft acceptance from 61-76% to 66-78% on four prompts and speed by +0.5 tok/s, inside the noise, so
  it stays off by default. `TF_GLM_SPEC_EARLY=0` (the head reads the kept row after the round's read, as the old
  serial engine did, instead of every verify row before it) was 1 to 2 tok/s slower at both depth caps: the head
  on every row before the read costs less than the round trip it saves, so early speculation stays.
- Where an extra verify row goes (real first 8 layers, 1 to 8 rows): the MoE block 0.48 to 1.56 ms a layer (the
  distinct experts a window adds: 12.6 MB each), KDA 0.44 to 0.88 (rows run in order inside the kernel), MLA
  attention 0.49 to 1.12, hyper-connections flat.
- The floor: about 9 GB of 4-bit weights a token at ~630 GB/s is 14.5 ms, so serial tops out near 69 tok/s here
  and drafted rounds near 80-85 at the measured acceptance and row cost. Flash Next's 114 comes from 4.26 GB a
  token. Fewer bytes a token (or a draft head that lands more often) is what would take this family to 100 on
  this chip; the kernel room left in the one-row step is about 6 ms (the indexer's small ops, the 90
  hyper-connection boundaries, launch latency).

### Where the time goes

Stubbing one part at a time out of the 22.3 ms one-row step: routed and shared experts 9.9 ms (about 540 GB/s), KDA
4.9 ms, sparse attention 3.5 ms (about 2.4 ms of it the indexer's small ops), hyper-connection boundaries 2.25 ms
(90 of them, launch latency), head 0.6 ms, dense MLP 0.3 ms; with all of them stubbed, 1.8 ms remains.

### Tried and rejected

- Draft depth past 1 on prose and code: slower on every workload but file edits (table above). The second draft
  chained from the MTP head's own output lands too rarely.
- The four norms after MLA's stacked projection in one kernel: 468.6 against 477.2 us for the layer, no gain. MLX
  already ran them concurrently, and one kernel serialized them.
- A hyper-connection boundary in two kernels instead of three: one row 3.46 to 3.22 ms on 4 layers, but 2 rows 3.70
  to 4.36 ms. It made verify windows slower.
- Same-bits variants of MLX's 4-bit matvec for the big projections: about 545 GB/s against MLX's 630.
- A multi-query sparse-attention kernel as a new serial reference (strategy C): exact across rows, but the step did
  not move (19.90 against 19.81 ms, 8 layers at 8 rows), so changing serial's bits was not worth it.
- More or fewer output rows a simdgroup in `qmv_rows` and the expert kernels: 4 was best.

### Traps we hit

- MLX 0.32.0 on a 256 GB M3 Ultra: decode fell from 38 to about 8 tok/s within three requests. The GPU sat idle at 4
  to 6 W while the weights dropped out of wired memory. MLX 0.32.2 fixed it (57 to 58 tok/s, steady). The 512 GB
  Studio never showed it. Use MLX 0.32.2 or later; the load-time row check passes on both versions.
- A missing threadgroup barrier after folding `f_b` / `g_b` into the KDA kernel broke row exactness only at the
  real 128-wide heads, not on the small test model. The real-weight tests caught it.
- Stacking MLA's projections on the prefill path changed MLX's batched tiling and so the prefilled cache. The
  prefill keeps the separate matrices; only the decode path stacks them. A golden-logits check caught it.
- A knife-edge prompt: a weekday question where a float32 forward of the stored weights answers "Friday" by 1.2
  logits and a bf16 engine can answer "Monday" through rounding. Check such differences against float32 before
  treating them as regressions.

### Exactness

- Full model, M3 Ultra: drafted replies equal to `"draft": false` replies, 5 of 5 prompts, content, reasoning, tool
  calls and token counts, in two separate runs.
- Full model at 4,096 keys: the fused kernels' logits bit-identical to the kernels before them at 1, 2 and 4 rows;
  on the real first 8 layers, 16 serial steps and an 8-row window identical with them on and off.
- Real first 8 layers past 4,096 keys (sparse attention active): windows of 2, 3, 4, 8 and 16 rows equal to one-row
  steps. Real first 6 layers: the load-time check passes at 2, 3, 4 and 8 rows.
- Every kernel against the call the one-row path makes, `mx.array_equal`, at GLM's shapes or on its real layers:
  the MoE block at 1 to 16 rows with tied router scores, the hyper-connection boundary at 4 streams of 4,096, the
  router, the experts, `qmv_rows`, `qmv_quad` and the unquantized row matmuls.
- Against float32: over 600 teacher-forced tokens the decode path's top-1 agreed 98.17% of the time with a float32
  forward of the same stored weights.
- The load-time check (`runtime.rows_match_serial`) turns drafting off when a multi-row forward does not reproduce
  one-row steps on the machine it runs on.

`tests/test_glm5_*.py` and `tests/test_glm_tool_calls.py` run on a small synthetic checkpoint (CPU and Metal). With
`TF_GLM5_MODEL` pointing at the checkpoint, two more tests run on its real first layers.

### Limits

- Prompts are prefilled through MLX's own kernels (the prefill path), the same known limit as Flash Next and
  Nemotron: a reply can depend on what was cached. Drafted and serial decoding from the same cache agree.
- Prefill: about 290 to 370 tok/s cold at 17k to 23k tokens, 4 to 18% slower than oMLX cold on the same Macs. A
  7k-token tail after a 39k-token cached prefix ran at about 162 tok/s; that path has not been tuned.
- The system block is saved as a snapshot: a new session with a 22.7k-token system and tools block started in 0.8 s
  after a restart, against 66 s cold.
- GLM tool calls (`<tool_call>NAME<arg_key>...</arg_key><arg_value>...</arg_value></tool_call>`) come back as
  OpenAI `tool_calls`, values converted by each parameter's declared type. In a streamed reply they arrive at the
  end.
- Measured on M3 Ultra only, one request at a time. M5 is untested.

### Next

- The indexer's glue in one scoring kernel and a radix select, as Flash Next does: about 1.5 to 2 ms a token, but
  it changes the block choice's bits and needs a float32 fidelity check first.
- The hyper-connection write-back folded into the MoE combine (exact, about 0.4 ms), and grouped verify experts.
- A better chained draft. The CUDA engine found the MTP head agrees more often when it reads the final-normed
  hidden row; this engine still feeds it the streams' mean before the norm, as oMLX's GLM runtime does. Worth
  trying here.
- A faster long-context prefill, through the decode kernels in chunks.
