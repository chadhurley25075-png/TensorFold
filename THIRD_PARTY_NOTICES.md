# Third-party notices

TensorFold depends on [MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx) and
[mlx-lm](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm) (MIT License, Copyright © 2023
Apple Inc.), installed as packages.

## Code adapted from mlx-lm

These files reproduce parts of mlx-lm 0.31.3 so their results match mlx-lm's
bit for bit, under mlx-lm's MIT License (Copyright © 2023 Apple Inc.):

- `src/tensorfold/kernels/gdn_capture.py` follows
  `mlx_lm/models/qwen3_5.py` (`GatedDeltaNet.__call__`) op for op.
- `src/tensorfold/kernels/lane_tree.py` repeats the arithmetic of mlx-lm's
  `gated_delta_step` Metal kernel (`mlx_lm/models/gated_delta.py`) inside its
  own kernels.

## Code adapted from transformers and mlx-vlm

The n-gram embedding's id helpers of Qwen3.8 Flash Next (`_splitmix64`, `_is_prime`,
`_find_nth_prime_after`, the per-layer multipliers and the shift-and-xor id mixing) in
`src/tensorfold/families/qwen4_exp/model.py` and `src/tensorfold/families/qwen4_exp/cuda/ngram.py` are
translated, with renamed identifiers, into MLX and NumPy from Hugging Face transformers'
`models/qwen4_exp/modeling_qwen4_exp.py` (Copyright 2026 The Qwen Team and The HuggingFace Inc. team),
licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0; the license text is in
[`LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt`](LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt). The same helpers are in mlx-vlm's
`models/qwen4_exp/language.py` (MIT License, Copyright (c) 2025 Prince Canuma).

## GLM-5.3-Flash on Apple Silicon

- The GLM tool-call argument conversion in `src/tensorfold/server/http.py` (`coerce_glm_value`) is adapted from
  oMLX's `_coerce_param_value` (`omlx/api/tool_calling.py`, Apache License, Version 2.0, text in
  [`LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt`](LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt)), without its repair of near-valid JSON.

## CUDA engines

On Linux the CUDA engines use [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) (BSD-3-Clause) and
[Triton](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton) (MIT), taken from NVIDIA's PyTorch container, not bundled. Their
kernels are written for TensorFold. What they follow:

- `src/tensorfold/families/qwen3_5/cuda/` implements the model math of mlx-lm's `qwen3_5` model (MIT, above).
- The CUDA DFlash2 drafters (`families/qwen3_5/cuda/dflash2.py`, `families/glm5_next/cuda/dflash2.py`) port the
  DFlash2 architecture of z-lab's `dflash/model_mlx.py` to PyTorch and Triton, under its MIT License
  (Copyright (c) 2026 Z Lab, text below).
- `src/tensorfold/families/qwen4_exp/cuda/` implements the model math of transformers'
  `modeling_qwen4_exp.py` (Apache-2.0, above) in its own kernels; `gdn.cu` reproduces the gated delta rule
  with flash-linear-attention's numerics (MIT) in a new kernel, and `comm.py` calls NCCL on the caller's stream
  the way vLLM's `pynccl` does (Apache-2.0), without code from either.
- `src/tensorfold/families/glm5_next/cuda/` implements the math of the GLM-5 definition in Hugging Face
  [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) (`models/glm5_next/modular_glm5_next.py`,
  Apache-2.0), with its own kernels; no code from it is included. The hidden states GLM's DFlash2 reads and
  its thinking-off chat rendering were checked against Mia-AiLab's GLM-5.3-Flash DGX Spark recipe; no code from
  that recipe is included either.
- GLM-5.3-Flash's EXL3 support (`families/glm5_next/cuda/exl3.py`, `exl3.cu`, `exl3_mm.py`) reads the EXL3
  format of [ExLlamaV3](https://github.com/turboderp-org/exllamav3) (MIT License, Copyright (c) 2025 Turboderp,
  text below): its trellis layout, its "mcg" codebook and its tensor-core fragment order. The decoder and kernels
  are written for TensorFold and checked bit for bit against ExLlamaV3's dequantization.

## Vendored code

- `src/tensorfold/drafters/vendor/z_lab_dflash/model_mlx.py` is
  `dflash/model_mlx.py` from [z-lab/dflash](https://github.com/z-lab/dflash),
  MIT License, Copyright (c) 2026 Z Lab, unmodified.

## Model weights

TensorFold ships no weights. The DFlash2 draft model it can use for
Qwen3.8-27B (`z-lab/Qwen3.8-27B-DFlash2`) is published under Apache-2.0 per its
model card. GLM-5.3-Flash's optional DFlash2 draft model
(`incoai/GLM-5.3-Flash-DFlash2`) is published under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 (non-commercial
use only) per its model card; without it GLM drafts with its own MTP head. Each
model you serve keeps its own license.
