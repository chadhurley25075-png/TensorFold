## Code adapted from mlx-lm

bit for bit, under mlx-lm's MIT License (Copyright © 2023 Apple Inc.):

- `src/tensorfold/kernels/gdn_capture.py` follows
  `mlx_lm/models/qwen3_5.py` (`GatedDeltaNet.__call__`) op for op.
- `src/tensorfold/kernels/lane_tree.py` repeats the arithmetic of mlx-lm's
  `gated_delta_step` Metal kernel (`mlx_lm/models/gated_delta.py`) inside its
  own kernels.

## Code adapted from transformers and mlx-vlm

The n-gram embedding's id helpers of Qwen3.8 Flash Next (`_splitmix64`, `_is_prime`,
`_find_nth_prime_after`, the per-layer multipliers and the shift-and-xor id mixing) in
`src/tensorfold/families/qwen4_exp/model.py` and `src/tensorfold/families/qwen4_exp/cuda/ngram.py` are
translated, with renamed identifiers, into MLX and NumPy from Hugging Face transformers'
`models/qwen4_exp/modeling_qwen4_exp.py` (Copyright 2026 The Qwen Team and The HuggingFace Inc. team),

## GLM-5.3-Flash on Apple Silicon

The MLX engine of `glm5_next` (`src/tensorfold/families/glm5_next/model.py`, `mtp.py`, `runtime.py`) and its Metal
kernels (`src/tensorfold/kernels/glm/flash/v1/`) are written for TensorFold. What they follow or port:

- `families/glm5_next/model.py` follows, op for op on its prefill path, the GLM-5.3-Flash (`glm5_next`)
  implementation added to [mlx-vlm](https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-vlm) by PR #2030 (by Lazarus-931; MIT License,
  Copyright (c) 2025 Prince Canuma), as vendored by [oMLX](https://github.com/jundot/omlx) (Apache-2.0). Nothing is
  imported from either at runtime.
- `kernels/glm/flash/v1/kda.py` is ported from mlx-vlm PR #2105 ("glm5_next: fuse the KDA decode chain into one
  Metal kernel", by avlp12; `mlx_vlm/models/glm5_next/fused_kda.py`; closed without merging, MIT License,
  Copyright (c) 2025 Prince Canuma): the whole KDA decode step in one Metal kernel. TensorFold runs a window of
  rows in order inside the launch, folds the 4-bit `f_b` / `g_b` projections in with MLX's one-row `qmv_quad`
  arithmetic, and keeps its own rounding points. Its precision rules (precise exp, uncontracted sums of squares)
  are also used in `fused.py`.
- `kernels/glm/flash/v1/sparse_attention.py` is mlx-vlm's `indexed_sparse_attention` kernel
  (`mlx_vlm/models/sparse_attention.py`) as extended by mlx-vlm PR #2245 ("Fix GLM-5.3 cached decode batch
  invariance", by raullenchai; closed without merging, MIT License, Copyright (c) 2025 Prince Canuma), adapted to
  TensorFold's single latent cache.
- mlx-vlm PR #2107 (the sparse indexer's incremental decode and a stale-pool fix, by avlp12) needed no code:
  TensorFold's cache already pools once per completed block. Its stale-pool case is pinned by
  `tests/test_glm5_ported_kernels.py`.
- The hyper-connection kernel `_HC_SPLIT` in `kernels/glm/flash/v1/kernels.py`, and the sinkhorn and collapse in
  `fused.py`, repeat the `hc_sinkhorn_collapse` kernel of mlx-vlm's `mlx_vlm/models/deepseek_v4/hyper_connection.py`
  (MIT License, Copyright (c) 2026 Apple Inc.), with its output type set to the input's.
- The 4-bit matvec `_QMV_ROWS` in `kernels.py` is Flash Next's `qmv_rows` with MLX's group-64 scale indexing, and
  the expert kernels (`_EXPERT_GROUP`, `_EXPERT_QMV`) follow Flash Next's `expert_group` / `grouped_gateup`. The
  row kernels in `kernels.py` and `fused.py` repeat the arithmetic and partitions of MLX 0.32's own kernels (MIT
  License, Copyright © 2023 Apple Inc.): `qmv_fast`, `qmv_quad` and `gather_qmv_fast` (`quantized.h`), `GEMVKernel`
  and `GEMVTKernel` (`gemv.h`) and the `rms_norm` kernels, one row per grid slice with the tiling MLX picks for one
  row, so each row keeps MLX's one-row bits.
- The GLM tool-call argument conversion in `src/tensorfold/server/http.py` (`coerce_glm_value`) is adapted from
  oMLX's `_coerce_param_value` (`omlx/api/tool_calling.py`, Apache License, Version 2.0, text in
  [`LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt`](LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt)), without its repair of near-valid JSON.

## CUDA engines

On Linux the CUDA engines use [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) (BSD-3-Clause) and
[Triton](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton) (MIT), taken from NVIDIA's PyTorch container, not bundled. Their
kernels are written for TensorFold. What they follow:

- `src/tensorfold/families/qwen3_5/cuda/` implements the model math of mlx-lm's `qwen3_5` model (MIT, above).
- The CUDA DFlash2 drafters (`families/qwen3_5/cuda/dflash2.py`, `families/glm5_next/cuda/dflash2.py`) port the
  DFlash2 architecture of z-lab's `dflash/model_mlx.py` to PyTorch and Triton, under its MIT License
  (Copyright (c) 2026 Z Lab, text below).
- `src/tensorfold/families/qwen4_exp/cuda/` implements the model math of transformers'
  `modeling_qwen4_exp.py` (Apache-2.0, above) in its own kernels; `gdn.cu` reproduces the gated delta rule
  with flash-linear-attention's numerics (MIT) in a new kernel, and `comm.py` calls NCCL on the caller's stream
  the way vLLM's `pynccl` does (Apache-2.0), without code from either.
- `src/tensorfold/families/glm5_next/cuda/` implements the math of the GLM-5 definition in Hugging Face
  [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) (`models/glm5_next/modular_glm5_next.py`,
  Apache-2.0), with its own kernels; no code from it is included. The hidden states GLM's DFlash2 reads and
  its thinking-off chat rendering were checked against Mia-AiLab's GLM-5.3-Flash DGX Spark recipe; no code from
  that recipe is included either.
- GLM-5.3-Flash's EXL3 support (`families/glm5_next/cuda/exl3.py`, `exl3.cu`, `exl3_mm.py`) reads the EXL3
  format of [ExLlamaV3](https://github.com/turboderp-org/exllamav3) (MIT License, Copyright (c) 2025 Turboderp,
  text below): its trellis layout, its "mcg" codebook and its tensor-core fragment order. The decoder and kernels
  are written for TensorFold and checked bit for bit against ExLlamaV3's dequantization.

## Vendored code

- `src/tensorfold/drafters/vendor/z_lab_dflash/model_mlx.py` is
  `dflash/model_mlx.py` from [z-lab/dflash](https://github.com/z-lab/dflash),
  MIT License, Copyright (c) 2026 Z Lab, unmodified.

## Model weights

TensorFold ships no weights. The DFlash2 draft model it can use for
Qwen3.8-27B (`z-lab/Qwen3.8-27B-DFlash2`) is published under Apache-2.0 per its
model card. GLM-5.3-Flash's optional DFlash2 draft model
(`incoai/GLM-5.3-Flash-DFlash2`) is published under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 (non-commercial
use only) per its model card; without it GLM drafts with its own MTP head. Each
model you serve keeps its own license.
